CRUD with PHP and Angular with token verification

Get the database (MySQL) from DB folder, unzip the rar attachment and import it into your xampp or wampp

To get you started, open serverside/Main.php and configure your server then simply run the project from localhost  

Add a new apartment on the home page with a familiar email that you have the login credentials for

Open your email for the edit and update links (which have validation tokens)

If you have an error with the email, simply upload the project and retry from a live server

Cheers.
